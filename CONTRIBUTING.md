# How to run
Open this directory in VSCode. Click Run -> Start Debugging (F5). This will open the extension in a new window of VSCode. In this window, you can use the extension regularly. After making updates, focus the new window and hit cmd-R to refresh the extension. (Note: this will delete anything you have in that window.)



# How to run tests
From this directory, run `yarn test`. The tests will open in a separate VSCode instance. Close any dialogs the new instance spawns. The results of the tests will show in the terminal.
