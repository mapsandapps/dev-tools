* keep watching the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5V4T3o3CXE&list=WL&index=2
* add a setting for string format (e.g. rgb(0,0,0) vs rgb(0, 0, 0))
* write tests
* what's the difference between registerCommand and registerTextEditorCommand?


DONE
* convert rgba array to string
* add an input box in extension - to get hex from user
* perhaps instead of taking an input, it should use the selected text
* perhaps have the command palette just be "convert color" and then once that's selected, have a menu pop up with each option to convert to and display a preview of what the first selected item will change to (although this requires more typing from user, so might not be as good?)
